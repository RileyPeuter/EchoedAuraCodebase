		<speaker>Jayf</speaker>
		<dialogue>That's an impressive amount of big words, but perhaps try speaking plainly. 
		Who are you?</dialogue>
	</frame>

	<frame>
		<speaker>Iraden</speaker>
		<dialogue>I want to enrol</dialogue>
	</frame>

	<frame>
		<speaker>Jayf</speaker>
		<dialogue>That's obvious, hence my question. Who are you? \n We aren't exactly advertising for new people.</dialogue>
	</frame>

	<frame>
		<speaker>Iraden</speaker>
		<dialogue>We're hiring people of more peculiar, specialised and specific skills. 
		Things that can't be gotten from anywhere else.</dialogue>
	</frame>
	
	<frame>
		<speaker>Iraden</speaker>
		<dialogue>I'm quiet and fast. 
		And I studied mana weaving.</dialogue>

		<speaker>Jayf</speaker>
		<dialogue>Well, do tell me, at what academy</dialogue>
	</frame>
	
	<frame>
		<speaker>Iraden</speaker>
		<dialogue>I didn't need one. I bought books with what my father left me.</dialogue>
	</frame>
	<frame>
		<speaker>Jayf</speaker>
		<dialogue>As I thought.
		'Self Taught' mages tend to be danger to themselves and those around</dialogue>

	<frame>
		<speaker>Iraden</speaker>
		<dialogue>I learnt the Cerilin ice saw lighter, so that it can be thrown.\n And I can do it really quickly</dialogue>
	</frame>

	<frame>
		<speaker>Jayf</speaker>
		<dialogue>
			Hmm. Learning that by books alone would be an achievement. \n A mouse scurrying through the cracks, sticking people \n with ice could be useful to us.

	<frame>
		<speaker>Jayf</speaker>
		<dialogue>
			If what you say is true...
		</dialogue>
	</frame>

	<frame>
		<speaker>Jayf</speaker>
		<dialogue>
			Walk with me to the training ground and show me what you can do.
