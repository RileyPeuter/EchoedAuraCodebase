			Very funny. But there's not really much to this one. 
			You're to report to a keep out East. Do a bit of survey work, and

			Survey work? You made it sound like it was a matter of importance. 
			Surely we can do more than just survey.

	</frame>

	<frame>
		<speaker>Asa</speaker>

			Morthred. All our missions are important.

	<frame>
		<speaker>Fray</speaker>
		<dialogue>
			Obviously there's a little more to this than that. 
			Some sort of cloak and dagger stuff. 
			Please tell me there's more to it than this Asa. 
		</dialogue>
	</frame>

	<frame>
		<speaker>Asa</speaker>
		<dialogue>
			You would be correct. I appreciate your enthusiasm
			I need you to do exactly as I ask. Some missions may be mundane, but
			we don't make you do them for no reason at all. Trust us. 
			Things are often more than they seem.
